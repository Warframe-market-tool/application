Firt, a word to say this project couldn't exist without the hard work of Jean Baptiste Chanut.

Thanks to him.

# How to compile

## Install the ps2exe package
```powershell
Install-Module -Name ps2exe -Scope CurrentUser
```
## Compile the script to .exe under a cmd on Windows
```cmd
start build.cmd
```

It will do all the necessary step to compile the script, the configuration path and the .xml file needed.


# Before you use the program

You need to edit the ```config.json``` file to include your email and password from waframe market.

```json
{
    "email": "",
    "password": ""
}
```

That's it !
